;;; Commentary:
;; An Emacs port of the Everforest Vim theme, a low-contrast green-coloured
;; theme. This is a current work in progress, so expect issues and unorthodox
;; coloring occasionally. The port is quite opinionated from the original
;; everforest theme, but I try to keep as true to the original theme as
;; possible, but making changes where needed for both functional and cosmetic
;; reasons.

;;; Code:
